## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check kernel and daemon logs
3. **Limit access**: Use appropriate file permissions
4. **Network security**: Secure network communications if applicable
5. **Audit regularly**: Review system configurations

### For Developers

1. **Code review**: All kernel code must be reviewed
2. **Static analysis**: Use tools like sparse for kernel code
3. **Input validation**: Validate all user input
4. **Memory safety**: Ensure proper memory management
5. **Error handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling

## Security Features

### Kernel Module Security

- **Input validation**: All user input is validated
- **Memory safety**: Proper memory allocation and deallocation
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Access control**: Proper file permissions on /proc interface
- **Audit logging**: All operations are logged

### Daemon Security

- **Configuration validation**: All configuration is validated
- **Secure communication**: Secure communication with kernel module
- **Error recovery**: Graceful error handling and recovery
- **Resource limits**: Proper resource usage limits
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails

### CLI Security

- **Input sanitization**: All input is sanitized
- **Error reporting**: Secure error reporting
- **Access control**: Proper access control for privileged operations
- **Audit trails**: All operations are logged

## Known Vulnerabilities

This section will list any known security vulnerabilities and their status.

| CVE | Description | Status | Fixed in |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------|
| None currently | - | - | - |

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2) and should be applied immediately.

### How to apply security updates

1. **Kernel module**: Rebuild and reload the kernel module
2. **Daemon**: Update and restart the daemon
3. **CLI**: Update the CLI tool
4. **Configuration**: Review and update configuration if needed
